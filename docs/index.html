      <b>Jumping frog.</b> 
      There is a frog at position $1000$ on the number line. 
      Each time, the frog jumps to an integer between its current position and $1$. 
      What is the expected number of jumps the frog takes to reach the origin?

      <summary>Hint</summary>
      <p>
        Define $f(n)$ as the expected number of jumps if the frog is at position $n$.
        Now set up a recursion involving $f(n)$.

      <b>Presents exchange.</b>
      There are 8 people at a birthday, and each person brings a gift. 
      How many ways are there for the 8 people to exchange gifts, such that everyone recieves one gift and no one recieves his own gift? 
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>Hint</summary>
      <p>
        There are $8!$ ways of exchanging gifts, but this include the cases where some people get their own gifts. 
        Define $E_i$ as the event where the event where the $i^\mathrm{th}$ person recieves his own gift.
        Then, we can use PIE to evaluate $|E_1 \cup \dots \cup E_8|$.

      <b>Combinatorics 1.</b> 
      Prove that $\binom{n+1}{k} = \binom{n}{k} +  \binom{n}{k-1}$.

    <details>
      <summary>Solution</summary>
      <p>
        We want to select $k$ people from a group of $n+1$ people that includes yourself.
        If we exclude ourself from the group, then there are $\binom{n}{k}$ possible selections.
        If we include ourself in the group, then there are $\binom{n}{k-1}$ possible selections.
        These selections are mutually exclusive so their sum must equal $\binom{n+1}{k}$.

      <b>Combinatorics 2.</b> 
      Prove that $\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}^2 = \binom{2n}{n}$. 
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>Solution</summary>
      <p>
        We want to select $n$ people from a group of $2n$ people. 
        There are $\binom{2n}{n}$ ways to do so.
        Alternatively, we may split the $2n$ people into two groups of $n$ people each.
        We select $k$ people from the first group, and $n-k$ people from the second group.
        Hence, the total number of selections possible is: $\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} \binom{n}{n-k}$.
        But $\binom{n}{n-k} = \binom{n}{k}$ so this is just the above sum.

    <details>
      <summary>Solution</summary>
      <p>
        The same logic as combinatorics 2, but now you want to select $n+1$ people from a group of $2n$ people.
