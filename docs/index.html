      <b>Presents exchange.</b>
      There are 8 people at a birthday, and each person brings a gift. 
      How many ways are there for the 8 people to exchange gifts, such that everyone recieves one gift and no one recieves his own gift? 
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>Hint</summary>
      <p>
        There are $8!$ ways of exchanging gifts, but this include the cases where some people get their own gifts. 
        Define $E_i$ as the event where the event where the $i^\mathrm{th}$ person recieves his own gift.
        Then, we can use PIE to evaluate $|E_1 \cup \dots \cup E_8|$.

      <b>Combinatorics 1.</b> 
      Prove that $\binom{n+1}{k} = \binom{n}{k} +  \binom{n}{k-1}$.

    <details>
      <summary>Solution</summary>
      <p>
        We want to select $k$ people from a group of $n+1$ people that includes yourself.
        If we exclude ourself from the group, then there are $\binom{n}{k}$ possible selections.
        If we include ourself in the group, then there are $\binom{n}{k-1}$ possible selections.
        These selections are mutually exclusive so their sum must equal $\binom{n+1}{k}$.

      <b>Combinatorics 2.</b> 
      Prove that $\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}^2 = \binom{2n}{n}$.

    <details>
      <summary>Solution</summary>
      <p>
        We want to select $n$ people from a group of $2n$ people. 
        There are $\binom{2n}{n}$ ways to do so.
        Alternatively, we may split the $2n$ people into two groups of $n$ people each.
        We select $k$ people from the first group, and $n-k$ people from the second group.
        Hence, the total number of selections possible is: $\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} \binom{n}{n-k}$.
        But $\binom{n}{n-k} = \binom{n}{k}$ so this is just the above sum.

        The same logic as combinatorics 2, but now you want to select $n+1$ people from a group of $2n$ people.

      <b>Coin tossing 3.</b> 
      Alice has $n+2$ coins and Bob has $n$ coins. 
      If both of them toss their coins at the same time, what is the probability that Alice has more heads than Bob?
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>Hint</summary>
      <p>
        Let Alice and Bob both toss $n$ coins. 
        Define $p_{A1}$ as the probability that Alice has exactly one more head than Bob, and $p_{B1}$ analogously.
        Define $p_A$ as the probability that Alice has more than one head than Bob, and $p_B$ analogously.
        Finally, define $p_D$ as the probability of a draw. 
        What is the desired probability in terms of $p_A$, $p_{A1}$ and $p_D$?
        What is $p_{A1}$ and $p_D$? 
        The above combinatorial identities may be useful.

        Method 1: Define $E_i$ as the event where there is a pair of adjacent $1$s in which the first $1$ is at position $i$.
        Calculate $|E_1 \cup E_2 \cup E_3 \cup E_4|$ using PIE.

      <p>
        Method 2: Consider the integers in the range $0$ to $10^n - 1$. 
        Define $f(n, 0)$ as the number of integers that has no adjacent $1$s and whose last digit is not $1$. 
        Define $f(n, 1)$ as the number of integers that has no adjacent $1$s and whose last digit is $1$. 
        Set up a recursion involving $f(n, 0)$ and $f(n, 1)$.
