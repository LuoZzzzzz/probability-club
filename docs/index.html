      <b>Coin tossing 1.</b> 
      What is the expected number of coin tosses before you land a. $HHH$, b. $HHT$, c. $HTH$, d. $THH$? 
      The coin is fair.

      <b>Dice game 1.</b> 
      A fair $n$ sided dice is tossed repeatedly until the sum of all the throws is at least $n$.
      What is the expected number of tosses?
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>Hint</summary>
      <p>
        Define $f(n, k)$ as the expected number of throws to be at least $k$ for a $n$ sided die. 
        Find an recursion involving $f(n, k)$ for $k \le n$.

      <b>Jumping frog.</b> 
      There is a frog at position $1000$ on the number line. 
      Each time, the frog jumps to an integer between its current position and $1$. 
      What is the expected number of jumps the frog takes to reach the origin?
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>Hint</summary>
      <p>
        Define $f(n)$ as the expected number of jumps if the frog is at position $n$.
        Now set up a recursion involving $f(n)$.

      <b>Presents exchange.</b>
      There are 8 people at a birthday, and each person brings a gift. 
      How many ways are there for the 8 people to exchange gifts, such that everyone recieves one gift and no one recieves his own gift? 
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>Hint</summary>
      <p>
        There are $8!$ ways of exchanging gifts, but this include the cases where some people get their own gifts. 
        Define $E_i$ as the event where the event where the $i^\mathrm{th}$ person recieves his own gift.
        Then, we can use PIE to evaluate $|E_1 \cup \dots \cup E_8|$.
