      <b>Dice game $3$.</b> 
      Alice and Bob take turns throwing a single fair $6$ sided die.
      The game ends when the sum of Alice's latest two throws is $8$, or when the sum of Bob's latest two throws is $7$. 
      If Alice starts first, what is the probability that she wins?

      <b>Dice game $4$.</b> 
      A $4$ sided die is rolled repeatedly until the sum first exceeds $100$ (ie. becomes strictly greater). What is the expected value of the sum 
      we stop at? Previously, we assumed that the sum is intially $0$. What if the sum started at $96$ instead? (Source: JS Glassdoor)

      <b>Ball game $2$.</b> 
      There are $5$ bins and you have an infinite supply of balls. You throw balls towards the bins, which land randomly in any of the 
      bins. Each time a ball lands in an empty bin you recieve a dollar, otherwise you lose a dollar. You can choose to stop playing at
      any time. What will your strategy be, and what is its expected value? (Source: JS Glassdoor)

      <b>Dice game $5$.</b> 
      You play a game where you roll a dice. After each roll, you can either choose to walk off with the current value of the dice (in dollars), or to
      reroll the dice. You can reroll up to three times. What is the fair value of this game, and what is your strategy? Now, suppose each 
      reroll costs $70$ cents. How will you play the game? (Source: JS Glassdoor)

      <p>
        We want to select $k$ people from a group of $n+1$ people that includes yourself.
        If we exclude ourself from the group, then there are $\binom{n}{k}$ possible selections.
        If we include ourself in the group, then there are $\binom{n}{k-1}$ possible selections.
        These selections are mutually exclusive so their sum must equal $\binom{n+1}{k}$.

    <details>
      <summary>Solution</summary>
      <p>
        We want to select $n$ people from a group of $2n$ people. 
        There are $\binom{2n}{n}$ ways to do so.
        Alternatively, we may split the $2n$ people into two groups of $n$ people each.
        We select $k$ people from the first group, and $n-k$ people from the second group.
        Hence, the total number of selections possible is: $\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} \binom{n}{n-k}$.
        But $\binom{n}{n-k} = \binom{n}{k}$ so this is just the above sum.

        Let Alice and Bob both toss $n$ coins. 
        Define $p_{A1}$ as the probability that Alice has exactly one more head than Bob, and $p_{B1}$ analogously.
        Define $p_A$ as the probability that Alice has more than one head than Bob, and $p_B$ analogously.
        Finally, define $p_D$ as the probability of a draw. 
        What is the desired probability in terms of $p_A$, $p_{A1}$ and $p_D$?
        What is $p_{A1}$ and $p_D$?

      <b>Dice game $2$.</b> 
      An unfair $6$ sided die is rolled until we observe all $6$ sides at least once each. 
      $P(1) = P(2) = 1/4, P(3) = P(4) = P(5) = P(6) = 1/8$. What is the expected number of rolls?
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>Hint</summary>
      <p>
        Consider a fair $8$ sided die with sides $1_A, 1_B, 2_A, 2_B, 3, 4, 5, 6$. 
        We can play same game with this dice and stop whenever one of each digit ($1_A$ and $1_B$ both count as $1$) has appeared.
        Now, if we play a slightly different game where we want all $8$ faces to appear at least once, the expected number of tosses will be $8H(8)$.
        However, there will be certain sequences in this game with redundant throws at the end compared to the original game.
        For example, the sequence $1_A, 2_A, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1_B, 2_B$ has $\frac{8}{1} + \frac{8}{2} = 12$ expected redundant throws at the end.
        The sequence $1_A, 2_A, 3, 4, 5, 1_B, 6, 2_B$ has $\frac{8}{1} = 8$ expected redundant throws in the end. 
        Pay attention to the last two entries of the sequence - these entries determine the expected number of redundant throws for that sequence.
        In total, there are $56$ possible terminating pairs. 
        Of these, $8$ of them (ie. $(2_A, 1_B)$) have $12$ expected redundant throws.
        $20$ of them (ie. $(2_A, 2_B)$, $(6, 1_B)$) have $8$ expected redundant throws. 
        The expected number of redundant throws is therefore $\frac{8}{56} \times 12 + \frac{20}{56} \times 8$.
